# Key Features
* Supports the latest versions of AutoCAD DWG, DXF, DWF, DWT, STL, IGS, DGN, OBJ and CF2 files
* Convert CAD drawings to high quality PDF
* Convert CAD drawing to high quality raster images
* Convert CAD drawing to high quality vector files like SVG and WMF

## Getting Started
1. **Sign Up**. Before you begin, you need to sign up for an account on our [Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/) and retrieve your [credentials](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps).
2. **Minimum requirements**. This SDK requires [Python 2.7 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. **Install Aspose.CAD Cloud Python SDK**.

Please, add the following [PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-cad-cloud/) to your requirements.txt.
```
aspose-CAD-cloud>=19.11
```
Or install it using command line.
```
pip install aspose-cad-cloud
```
Import the dependencies to your code as follows.
```python
import aspose-cad-cloud
```
4. **Using the SDK**. The best way to become familiar with how to use the SDK is to read the [Developer Guide](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/cadcloud/Developer+Guide). The [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/cadcloud/Getting+Started) will help you to become familiar with the common concepts.

## Quick Examples
Please, look at [Examples](EXAMPLES.md) document.

To succeed with your on-premise service usage by the SDK, you need to:
1. Use the new API class constructor with base URL required parameter, API version and debug mode optional parameters.
```python
CadApi(base_url='yourServiceUrl')
```
2. Set *storage* or *storageName* parameters for each request where they're present (mandatory!).
